# CRA ARCGIS BASIC 

This template was intended to get started with a working arcgis map with minimal code so you can apply your own style. This template dislays a map, allows you to add or remove layers, and displays a legend for loaded layers.

**Make sure that the version of the argis css import in index.css  matches the version of @arcgis/core in the package.json.**

This app uses styled-components to manage css.

To use this template, download the files and run `npx create-react-app [my app name] --template file:[path to this folder]`.
