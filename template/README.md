# CRA ARCGIS CONTEXT 

This template was intended to get started with a working arcgis map with more complex code that takes advantage of React's context api in the manner used by ESRI.

This app allows you to load and control layers, select basemaps, show legend, and search for locations.

**Make sure that the version of the argis css import in index.css  matches the version of @arcgis/core in the package.json.**

This app uses styled-components to manage css.
